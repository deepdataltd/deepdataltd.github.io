                            Our store collects data to operate effectively and provide you the best experiences with our
                            services. You provide some of this data directly, such as when you create a personal
                            account.
                            We get some of it by recording how you interact with our services by, for example, using
                            technologies like cookies, and receiving error reports or usage data from software running
                            on your device. We also obtain data from third parties (including other companies). For
                            example, we supplement the data we collect by purchasing demographic data from other
                            companies. We also use services from other companies to help us determine a location based
                            on your IP address in order to customize certain services to your location. The data we
                            collect depends on the services
                            and features you use.

                        <dd>
                            Our web site uses the data we collect for three basic purposes: to operate our business and
                            provide (including improving and personalizing) the services we offer, to send
                            communications, including promotional communications, and to display advertising. In
                            carrying out these purposes, we combine data we collect through the various web site
                            services you use to give you a more seamless, consistent and personalized experience.
                            However, to enhance privacy, we have built in technological and procedural safeguards
                            designed to prevent certain data combinations. For example, we store data we collect from
                            you when you are unauthenticated (not signed in) separately from any account information
                            that directly identifies you, such as your name, email address or phone number.

                        <dd>
                            We share your personal data with your consent or as necessary to complete any transaction or
                            provide any service you have requested or authorized. For example, we share your content
                            with third parties when you tell us to do so. When you provide payment data to make a
                            purchase, we will share payment data with banks and other entities that process payment
                            transactions or provide other financial services, and for fraud prevention and credit risk
                            reduction. In addition, we share personal data among our controlled affiliates and
                            subsidiaries. We also share personal data with vendors or agents working on our behalf for
                            the purposes described in this statement. For example, companies we've hired to provide
                            customer service support or assist in protecting and securing our systems and services may
                            need access to personal data in order to provide those functions. In such cases, these
                            companies must abide by our data privacy and security requirements and are not allowed to
                            use personal data they receive from us for any other purpose. We may also disclose personal
                            data as part of a corporate transaction such as a merger
                            or sale of assets.
